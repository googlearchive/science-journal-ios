# Contributing to Science Journal iOS

## I have a question or want to report a problem

### App Store downloaded Science Journal

If you're having a problem with [Science Journal from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/science-journal-by-google/id1251205555?mt=8), the fastest way to get support is by using the in-app feedback button. This can be found by navigating to the experiment list screen, tapping on the hamburger menu, and then tapping "Feedback".

### Downloaded and built from GitHub

If you built the app yourself, somebody else, or any other distribution channel that wasn't Apple's App Store, this section is for you!

Upon your first pull request to Science Journal iOS, the [googlebot](https://github.com/googlebot) will ask you to sign the Google Contributor License Agreement.

## Why did my issue/PR get closed?

It's not you, it's us! Science Journal iOS might receive a lot of issues and PRs. In order to effectively work through them and give each the prompt attention it deserves, we need to keep a sharp focus on the work we have outstanding.

One way we do this is by closing issues that we don't feel are immediately actionable. This might mean that we need more information in order to investigate or, it might mean that we haven't been able to reproduce it using the provided info. In this case we might close the issue while we wait for others to reproduce the problem and possibly provide some more info that unlocks the mystery.

**A closed issue is not necessarily the end of the story!** If more info becomes available after an issue is closed, it can be reopened for further consideration.

One of the best ways we can keep Science Journal iOS an approachable, stable, and dependable app is to be deliberate about how we choose to modify it. If we don't adopt your changes or new feature, that doesn't mean it was bad work! It may be that the Science Journal philosophy about how to accomplish a particular task doesn't align well with your approach. The best way to make sure that your time is well spent in contributing to Science Journal iOS is to **start your work** on a modification or new feature **by opening an issue to discuss the problem or shortcoming**. As the Science Journal iOS maintainers, we will do our best to give early feedback about whether a particular goal and approach is likely to be something we want to adopt!
