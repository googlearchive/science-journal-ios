Use the sensors in your iPhone or iPad to measure and graph phenomena such as light, sound, and motion, or connect to external sensors via bluetooth to conduct experiments on the world around you.\n\nWith the Science Journal app, you can:\n• Measure light, sound, acceleration, air pressure, and more using your device’s built-in sensors.\n• Take notes and photos to document your science experiments. More note types coming soon!\n• Connect to external sensors using select Bluetooth-enabled Arduino devices.\n• Create automated triggers for recording data and taking notes.\n• Use sonification to hear the movement of your graphs.\n\nPermissions notice:\n• Bluetooth: needed to scan for bluetooth sensor devices.\n• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.\n• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.\n• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.\n• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.\n\nEducational activities by our partners:\nhttps://makingscience.withgoogle.com/science-journal/activities\nFor support: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/sciencejournal";

Atmospheric pressure also varies with weather conditions, dropping in the presence of stormy, unstable air, and rising when air stabilizes and skies clear.\n\nThe digital barometer in your phone measures atmospheric pressure in hectopascals. (A hectopascal is 100 pascals, where a pascal is one newton of force applied over a square meter of area.) You've probably heard weather forecasters give atmospheric pressure in millibars—this friendlier-sounding unit is equivalent to hectopascals.\n\nYou might be wondering: Why would a phone measure pressure? Atmospheric pressure changes measurably with even slight changes in elevation, say, when you climb a flight of stairs. So a digital barometer in a phone can help detect location changes, for example, telling you what floor of a building you are on, or whether you are driving on the upper or lower deck of a bridge.";

Given this process, EV values may differ between devices if f-number thresholds differ, as is the case between iPhone 8 (f1.8) and iPad (f2.4).\n\nSince EV is determined by measuring the brightness value of pixels captured, ambient light sources will produce a much lower value than they would if lux was determined by an infrared sensor—measurements are directly dependent on the position of the camera and what it captures.";

What you may not have realized is that your phone contains a device designed to detect magnetic fields: a magnetometer. By combining data from your phone's magnetometer with the phone's orientation in space, we can create a digital compass.\n\nAn old-fashioned compass is a low-tech magnetometer, with a magnetized needle that turns to align itself with the surrounding magnetic field. There's no tiny compass inside your phone, but instead a tiny three-axis sensor that uses electric currents to detect the magnetic field strength in the three dimensions of space. But this alone is not enough to create a compass!\n\nWhy does a compass need to combine the data from the magnetometer with the phone's orientation? Knowing the phone's orientation allows us to compute the magnetic rotation even when the phone is not held flat in the same plane as the Earth's magnetic field. We know that gravity is perpendicular to Earth's magnetic field, so we can use the direction of gravity from the accelerometer sensors to determine how much of the magnetic field is in the same plane as the Earth's magnetic field.";

Stand in an open area—preferably outdoors and far from power lines— if you want to be sure that your compass's red tip is aligning with the Earth's magnetic field.

"sensor_desc_second_paragraph_decibel" = "All sounds can be described in terms of their frequency and intensity.\n\nIntensity is what you measure here with the Science Journal sound intensity sensor, in units of decibels (dB). Intensity, or loudness, depends on the distance that a vibrating object moves each time it vibrates; we hear greater intensity as increased loudness.\n\nThe frequency (also, pitch or tone) of a sound wave is equivalent to its rate of vibration. The faster an object vibrates, the higher the pitch of the resulting sound. The Science Journal sound intensity sensor does not measure frequency—only loudness.\n\nOne important thing to know is that the microphone in your device is designed to be very sensitive to differences in sound waves over time, but not the absolute size of each wave.  We have tried to choose code that is likely to produce numbers similar to the reference numbers shown below, but each device may give consistently higher or lower numbers.  Scientists will usually calibrate a sensor like this to a known measurement.  For now, Science Journal can tell you whether your next train ride is louder than your next rock concert, but only if you bring the same phone to both events.\n\nAnother thing to know is that there are important differences between “sound intensity”, “sound intensity level”, and “sound pressure”.  We are treating them here as the same thing, but if you want to dig deeper, there’s many online resources about the differences.\n\nThe quietest sound that the average human ear can detect is defined as 0 dB. Ordinary conversation corresponds to about 60 dB, and sounds above about 140 dB are painful to the human ear. But sounds don't have to be painful to be harmful. Continued exposure to sounds of 90 dB—about the loudness of a vacuum cleaner—can eventually cause hearing loss.\n\nThe decibel scale is logarithmic, which makes for some trickiness: A sound source of 40 dB isn't twice as intense as one with 20 dB—it's 100 times more intense. Meanwhile, if one ringing alarm clock produces 70 dB, two ringing alarm clocks produce not 140 dB, but 73 dB. Like we said, it's a strange scale.\n\n10 dB rustling leaves\n20 dB whispering at 5 feet\n30 dB soft whisper\n50 dB rainfall\n60 dB normal conversation\n90 dB blender\n100 dB car without muffler\n110 dB shouting in ear\n120 dB thunder\n130 dB jackhammer\n140 dB airplane taking off";
